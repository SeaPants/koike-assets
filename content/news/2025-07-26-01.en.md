I gave a special invited talk titled "The Appeal of High-Context Data: Intelligent Learning Support Systems as Data Utilization Hubs" at the [Research Council of Evidence-Driven Education (EDE)](https://ederc.jp/english/) SIG on "Educational Data Utilization and Personalized Learning Environments."
Based on the history of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and research trends in educational data utilization, I discussed the potential of data that ITSs can provide and the importance of promoting ITSs adoption for this purpose.
